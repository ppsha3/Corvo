# Corvo
"Corvo" -  My very own digital voice assistant


To Do - 
1) Make it conversational/intelligent using Natural Language Processing
2) Use the power of selenium to automate various routine websites like StackOverFlow, github so that it gives the solution without you having to search for it.
3) Eventually scale it to include it in my home automation project(yet to start) :p
