# Corvo
"Corvo" -  A digital voice assistant which automates your web tasks and is conversational.


The first prototype opens a random 'FRIENDS' video on youtube when the user says 'Run FRIENDS protocol' :p

To Do - 
1) Make it conversational/intelligent using Natural Language Processing
2) Use the power of selenium to automate various routine websites like StackOverFlow, github so that it gives the solution without you having to search for it.
3) Eventually scale it to include it in my home automation project(yet to start) :p
